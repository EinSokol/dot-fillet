### DISPATCHERS ###

# hy3:makegroup, <h | v | opposite | tab>, [toggle], [ephemeral | force_ephemeral] - make a vertical / horizontal split or tab group

# toggle - if the focused node is the only child of its parent, which is of the type specified, the node's parent will be removed.
# ephemeral - the group will be removed once it contains only one node. does not affect existing groups.
# force_ephemeral - same as ephemeral, but converts existing single windows groups.
# hy3:changegroup, <h | v | tab | untab | toggletab | opposite> - change the group the node belongs to, to a different layout
# untab will untab the group if it was previously tabbed
# toggletab will untab if group is tabbed, and tab if group is untabbed
# opposite will toggle between horizontal and vertical layouts if the group is not tabbed.
# hy3:setephemeral, <true | false> - change the ephemerality of the group the node belongs to
# hy3:movefocus, <l | u | d | r | left | down | up | right>, [visible], [warp | nowarp] - move the focus left, up, down, or right
# visible - only move between visible nodes, not hidden tabs
# warp - warp the mouse to the selected window, even if general:no_cursor_warps is true.
# nowarp - does not warp the mouse to the selected window, even if general:no_cursor_warps is false.
# hy3:warpcursor - warp the cursor to the center of the focused node
# hy3:movewindow, <l | u | d | r | left | down | up | right>, [once], [visible] - move a window left, up, down, or right
# once - only move directly to the neighboring group, without moving into any of its subgroups
# visible - only move between visible nodes, not hidden tabs
# hy3:movetoworkspace, <workspace>, [follow, [warp | nowarp]] - move the active node to the given workspace
# follow - change focus to the given workspace when moving the selected node
# warp - warp the mouse to the selected window, even if general:no_cursor_warps is true.
# nowarp - does not warp the mouse to the selected window, even if general:no_cursor_warps is false.
# hy3:killactive - close all windows in the focused node
# hy3:changefocus, <top | bottom | raise | lower | tab | tabnode>
# top - focus all nodes in the workspace
# bottom - focus the single root selection window
# raise - raise focus one level
# lower - lower focus one level
# tab - raise focus to the nearest tab
# tabnode - raise focus to the nearest node under the tab
# hy3:togglefocuslayer, [nowarp] - toggle focus between tiled and floating layers
# nowarp - do not warp the mouse to the newly focused window
# hy3:focustab, [l | r | left | right | index, <index>], [prioritize_hovered | require_hovered], [wrap]
# l | r | left | right - direction to change focus towards
# index, <index> - select the indexth tab
# prioritize_hovered - prioritize the tab group under the mouse when multiple are stacked. use the lowest group if none is under the mouse.
# require_hovered - affect the tab group under the mouse. do nothing if none are hovered.
# wrap - wrap to the opposite size of the tab bar if moving off the end
# hy3:locktab, [lock | unlock] - lock the current tab, makingg it behave like a node
# hy3:debugnodes - print the node tree into the hyprland log
# ⚠️ ALPHA QUALITY hy3:setswallow, <true | false | toggle> - set the containing node's window swallow state
# ⚠️ ALPHA QUALITY hy3:expand, <expand | shrink | base> - expand the current node to cover other nodes
# expand - expand by one node
# shrink - shrink by one node
# base - undo all expansions
